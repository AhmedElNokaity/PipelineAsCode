/* https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin/issues/534  
Credentials dropdown does not show newly created credentials
The documentation needs to be updated to make it clear that 'Secret Text' 
cannot be used with this plugin -- it must be a username / password credential.
===
Anyone struggling with the issue of trying to add credentials with username and password but not showing the creds on the dropdown, try this it worked for me.

Jenkins > Credentials > System > Global Credentials (or whatever group you want to have access or your access allow) > Add Credentials.

Then go back to the Source Code Management section of the project, and select the credentials from the dropdown.
