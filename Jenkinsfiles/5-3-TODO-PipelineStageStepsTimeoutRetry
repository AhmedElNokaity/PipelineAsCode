/*
as per issue JENKINS-51454 Pipeline retry operation doesn't retry when there is a timeout inside of it
Description
When a timeout call is fired inside of a retry, retry is not being triggered 
and job execution is aborted, the only way to make it work is by surrounding the timeout operation with a try/catch.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59561757/retry-after-timeout-in-jenkins-pipeline-workarounds  

Example:

import org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.steps.FlowInterruptedException

retry(3) {

  try {

      timeout(time: 5, unit: 'MINUTES') {

        // something that can fail

      } // timeout ends

  } catch (FlowInterruptedException e) {
      // we re-throw as a different error, that would not 
      // cause retry() to fail (workaround for issue JENKINS-51454)
      error 'Timeout!'

  } // try ends

} // retry ends

//TODO try this solution

                    echo "after timeout"
